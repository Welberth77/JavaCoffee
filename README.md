Our project is based on a meteor impact simulation website that takes into account meteors around Earth and calculates their potential damage, estimates the number of people injured (based on population density), and assesses the impact in any location on the planet. This helps people understand the consequences of these phenomena and assists authorities in designing ways to minimize harm to the lives of those living in affected areas.
